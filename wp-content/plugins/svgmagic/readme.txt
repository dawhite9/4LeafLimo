This plugin includes SVGMagic to your site and enables .svg Upload to your media library.

== Description ==
This plugin creates a fallback for .svg images on your website. The Plugin automatically detects if the visitors browser supports .svg
images (all browsers above IE8) and replaces them with PNG images.

The advantage of SVGMagic is, that you don't have to create multiple versions of your images. The plugin will create them for you.

For the moment, you can't see the svg image in your media library.


== Installation ==
1. Upload `svg-magic/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Sit back and enjoy

== Frequently Asked Questions == 
1. Q: Do I need this plugin if I don't want to support Internet Explorer < 9
A: As every browser above IE8 supports .svg, you don't need this plugin.

2. Q: This plugin doesn`t seem to do anything?
A: SVG Magic only works, if your site is online. Local development isn't supported.
